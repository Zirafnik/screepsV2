# Screeps 2022

For setting up I used the typescript-starter-pack which already had implemented a working rollup solution for uploading to server.

I removed everything TS related AND all of the things I didn't know exactly what they do: tests/, formatting (eslint, prettier), docs, mapping?, ... I also cleared the .gitignore.

I did not uninstall any of the dependecies or devDependencies yet.

I did not manage to install Babel plugin for rollup to transpile new node code to 12.x or 10.x.
